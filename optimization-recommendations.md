# Optimization Recommendations

## Performance Improvements to Implement Later

### 1. Disable Console Logging in Myers Algorithm
- Remove or conditionally disable console.log statements in the Myers diff algorithm
- This will improve performance during diff calculations
- Consider using a debug flag or environment variable to control logging when needed
