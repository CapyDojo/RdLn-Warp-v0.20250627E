- **üé® AUTHENTIC PREVIEWS**: Theme cards display using actual colors and styling
- **‚ú® 3D ANIMATIONS**: Cards "waterfall down" with bounce physics and "roll back up" in reverse

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Unified Redlining**: Official production red/green color scheme across themes
- **Professional Document Comparison**: Myers algorithm-based diff engine optimized for legal documents
- **OCR Integration**: Multi-language optical character recognition with 50+ language support
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, professional interface with consistent visual effects
- **Client-Side Processing**: Complete confidentiality with no server uploads
- **Performance Optimized**: Chunked rendering for large documents (500k+ characters)
- **System Protection**: Smart resource management prevents browser crashes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
- **ComparisonInterface**: Main orchestration component (streamlined with extracted layouts)
- **DesktopInputLayout**: Desktop side-by-side input layout with shared resize handle
