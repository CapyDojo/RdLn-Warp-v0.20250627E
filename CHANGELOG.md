## Version 0.3.0 - "Graceful Substitution Detection"
*Released: June 26, 2025*

### üéØ Major Algorithm Improvements

#### **Refined Sentence Boundary Detection**
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Completely rewrote sentence boundary detection logic in `MyersAlgorithm.ts`
- **Problem Solved**: Previous algorithm incorrectly treated abbreviations and entity names (like "Co., Ltd.", "Inc.", "LLC.") as sentence boundaries, breaking up legitimate substitutions
- **New Approach**: Implemented precise sentence boundary detection that only considers:
  - Paragraph boundaries (`\n\n`) - always true sentence boundaries
  - Periods followed by significant whitespace (`\.\s{2,}`) - indicates intentional sentence separation
  - Periods followed by space and capital letter (`\.\s+[A-Z]`) - classic sentence transition pattern
- **Impact**: Legal documents with corporate entity names now produce clean, accurate substitutions instead of fragmented changes

#### **Enhanced Substitution Tolerance**
- **Increased word ratio tolerance** from 3:1 to 5:1 for substitution detection
- **Rationale**: Legal documents often have asymmetric substitutions (e.g., "Investment Advisory (Shanghai) Co., Ltd." ‚Üí "Partners LLP")
- **Result**: More intelligent grouping of related changes while maintaining precision

#### **Expanded Receptive Field Processing**
- **New Feature**: Implemented "Karpathy-inspired" attention mechanism for change segments
- **Technical Details**: Algorithm now collects complete change segments before processing, allowing for better context-aware decisions
- **Benefits**: 
  - Preserves whitespace relationships within substitutions
  - Better handling of mixed change types within logical units
  - More accurate detection of related changes

### üîß Technical Enhancements

#### **Improved Content Building**
- **New Method**: `buildContentWithWhitespace()` preserves exact spacing in substitutions
- **Enhancement**: Whitespace tokens are now intelligently included based on adjacent content type
- **Result**: Substitutions maintain proper formatting and readability

#### **Segment-Based Processing**
- **New Architecture**: `collectChangeSegment()` groups related changes before analysis
- **Algorithm**: Processes added/removed tokens and adjacent whitespace as unified segments
- **Advantage**: Prevents artificial fragmentation of logical change units

#### **Enhanced Token Grouping**
- **Refined Logic**: `shouldGroupTokens()` now considers:
  - Multiple meaningful tokens (2+ words)
  - Content length thresholds (10+ characters)
  - Token count thresholds (4+ tokens)
  - Sentence boundary respect
- **Impact**: Better balance between granularity and readability

### üé® User Experience Improvements

#### **Visual Output Enhancement**
- **Cleaner Substitutions**: Corporate entity changes now display as single, clean substitutions
- **Preserved Formatting**: Whitespace and punctuation maintain proper relationships
- **Reduced Noise**: Fewer fragmented changes in legal document comparisons

#### **Test Case Validation**
- **Success Metric**: Target test case now produces expected output:
  - ‚úÖ "including ACME" = unchanged
  - ‚úÖ "Investment Advisory (Shanghai) Co., Ltd." ‚Üí "Partners LLP" = clean substitution  
  - ‚úÖ " and its affiliates" = unchanged

### üèóÔ∏è Code Quality & Architecture

#### **Enhanced Debugging**
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed console logging throughout the chunking process
- **Traceability**: Each processing step now logs its decisions and rationale
- **Development Aid**: Easier debugging and algorithm refinement

## [0.2.1] - 2025-07-01
### Fixed
- **Performance:** Eliminated severe (~1500ms) resize lag on the output panel when displaying massive documents (500k+ characters) with distant redline changes. Replaced the previous static HTML freezing with a more robust 'Chunked Static Rendering' approach, using IntersectionObserver to virtualize content and keep the DOM lean.

### Changed
- **System Protection:** Significantly increased protection thresholds following performance breakthrough. Maximum document size raised from 1M to 5M characters, complex document threshold increased from 500k+100k to 2M+500k changes, and large document cooldown updated from 200k to 1M characters. These changes provide realistic headroom for enterprise-scale legal documents while preserving safety guardrails.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-07-02
### Fixed
- **UI Consistency:** Resolved glass panel visual inconsistency where output panel appeared to have "multiple layers of effects" compared to input panels. Root cause was DOM structural differences: input panels had simple structure (Panel ‚Üí Content) while output panel had nested structure (Wrapper ‚Üí Panel ‚Üí Chunks ‚Üí Content). Fixed by removing extra wrapper div around RedlineOutput component and streamlining chunk rendering to eliminate unnecessary DOM nesting. Added comprehensive CSS background normalization ensuring identical glassmorphism effects across all content panels.

## [0.2.3] - 2025-07-02
### Fixed
- **Paragraph Break Preservation:** Fixed critical issue where paragraph breaks (double newlines `\n\n`) were being lost during document comparison, causing all text to appear as a single paragraph in redline output. Root cause was in the single-pass paragraph splitting optimization where separators were not fully preserved during reconstruction. Fixed by updating `splitIntoParagraphsSinglePass()` to capture complete paragraph content including full separators (e.g., `\n\n`) instead of stopping at first newline. Also enhanced both RedlineOutput and EnhancedRedlineOutput components with explicit `white-space: pre-wrap` styling to ensure proper whitespace rendering in the browser.

## [0.2.4] - 2025-07-03
### Fixed
- **Redline Visual Styling:** Fixed critical issue where colored borders and backgrounds for additions/deletions were not displaying in the redline output panel. Root cause was an overly aggressive CSS rule in `glassmorphism.css` that used a wildcard selector (`*`) to reset all child element styling within chunk containers, inadvertently removing the theme-based borders and backgrounds from redlined text spans. Fixed by removing the wildcard selector while preserving the glass effect optimization, ensuring redline text now displays with proper light blue backgrounds for additions, light orange backgrounds for deletions, and colored borders around all changes.

## [0.2.5] - 2025-07-03
### Added
- **Waterfall Theme Selector:** Implemented elegant cascading hover effect for theme selection with physics-based animations. Theme cards now "waterfall down" with staggered bounce timing when hovering over the themes button and "roll back up" in reverse order when leaving. Each theme card displays authentic previews using that theme's actual colors, gradients, and styling. Cards cascade straight down, right-aligned to the themes button, with compact 240px width. Features React Portal rendering to avoid header clipping, continuous hover area for seamless interaction, and always-on drag-and-drop reordering with persistent localStorage. Enhanced with 3D perspective transforms (rotateX, scale) and dual easing curves for natural physics feel.
