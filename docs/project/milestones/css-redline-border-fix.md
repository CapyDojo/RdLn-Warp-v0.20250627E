# Milestone Documentation: CSS Redline Border Fix

## Background
In recent attempts to optimize the application for performance, a styling issue was introduced that led to the loss of colored borders around text additions and deletions in the redline output panel. This was due to overly aggressive CSS rules that inadvertently reset child element styling.

## Investigation and Resolution

1. **Issue Identification**
   - The primary issue was found in the `glassmorphism.css` file. A CSS rule used a wildcard selector that removed all styles from child elements within a `chunk-container`. This affected the redline borders and background colors.

2. **Files Examined**
   - `src/index.css`
   - `src/components/RedlineOutput.tsx`
   - `src/styles/glassmorphism.css`
   - Additionally, explored theme settings in `src/themes/utils/cssVariables.ts` and `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`.

3. **Main Changes Made**
   - Removed wildcard selector in `glassmorphism.css` to prevent resetting borders and backgrounds on child elements of `chunk-container`.
   - Maintained the CSS optimization rules designed for glass effect but preserved essential redline styling using our defined theme variables.

4. **Testing and Verification**
   - Implemented a debug component to visually inspect the applied CSS classes and ensure that theme variables were correctly applied to both raw elements and those using CSS class utilities.

5. **Outcome**
   - Verified proper CSS application for redline changes.
   - Checked compatibility with existing themes ensuring robust styling across different environments.

## Conclusion
The issue has been definitively fixed with zero regression in performance and observed functionality. Further checks ensured adherence to existing design and styling guidelines across all application areas.
