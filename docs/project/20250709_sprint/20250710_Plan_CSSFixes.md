# 20250710 - CSS Corner Radius Fixes

## Overview
This document details the CSS adjustments made to ensure consistent corner radii for input and output panels, specifically addressing issues with drag handle bars in both mobile and desktop views.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Mobile Output Panel Bottom Corners
- **Issue:** The bottom corners of the output panel on mobile view were not consistently rounded.
- **Fix:** Added a specific rule within the `@media (max-width: 1023px)` query to set `border-bottom-left-radius` and `border-bottom-right-radius` to `12px` for `.layout-current [data-output-panel] + .flex .glass-panel`.
- **File:** `src/styles/layouts/current-layout.css`

### 2. Desktop Input Panel Drag Handle Bar Bottom Corners
- **Issue:** The bottom corners of the input panel drag handle bar in desktop view were incorrectly set to `0.5rem` (7px) due to an `!important` rule.
- **Fix:** Modified the existing rule `.layout-current .glass-panel:has([data-resize-handle="input-panels"])` to explicitly set `border-bottom-left-radius` and `border-bottom-right-radius` to `12px !important;`.
- **File:** `src/styles/layouts/current-layout.css`

### 3. Desktop Output Panel Drag Handle Bar Bottom Corners
- **Issue:** The bottom corners of the output panel drag handle bar in desktop view were incorrectly set to `0.5rem` (7px) due to an `!important` rule.
- **Fix:** Modified the existing fallback rule `.layout-current [data-output-panel] + .flex .glass-panel` to explicitly set `border-bottom-left-radius` and `border-bottom-right-radius` to `12px !important;`.
- **File:** `src/styles/layouts/current-layout.css`

## Verification
All changes have been visually verified to ensure the correct 12px border-radius is applied to the specified elements in both mobile and desktop views.

## Next Steps
Monitor for any regressions or unexpected visual behaviors related to these changes.
